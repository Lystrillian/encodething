## About Base32

Base32 is an encoding method that uses printable ASCII characters.

In Base32, data is divided into 5 bits and converted into alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 2-7). Converts every 8 characters, and if the last is less than 8 characters, pad with the equal symbol (=).

The conversion table for Base32 characters is as follows.

| 5-bit data | Base32 character |
| --- | --- |
| 00000 | A |
| 00001 | B |
| 00010 | C |
| 00011 | D |
| 00100 | E |
| 00101 | F |
| 00110 | G |
| 00111 | H |
| 01000 | I |
| 01001 | J |
| 01010 | K |
| 01011 | L |
| 01100 | M |
| 01101 | N |
| 01110 | O |
| 01111 | P |
| 10000 | Q |
| 10001 | R |
| 10010 | S |
| 10011 | T |
| 10100 | U |
| 10101 | V |
| 10110 | W |
| 10111 | X |
| 11000 | Y |
| 11001 | Z |
| 11010 | 2 |
| 11011 | 3 |
| 11100 | 4 |
| 11101 | 5 |
| 11110 | 6 |
| 11111 | 7 |

For example, if you convert "Hello!" with Base32, it will be as follows.

1\. Make it a binary representation.

```
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001  (For US-ASCII / UTF-8)
```

2\. Separate every 5 bits. If it is less than 5 bits, pad it with "0" at the end.

```
01001 00001 10010 10110 11000 11011 00011 01111 00100 00100
```

3\. Convert to characters using a conversion table. Convert every 8 characters, and if it is less than 8 characters, pad the end with "=".

4\. Connect all the characters to get the Base32 conversion result.
