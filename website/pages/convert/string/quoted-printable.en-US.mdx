## About Quoted-printable

Quoted-printable is an encoding method that uses 7-bit printable ASCII characters. Used to transfer 8-bit data in a 7-bit data path in email.

Quoted-printable represents 8-bit data in 2-digit hexadecimal format, such as =XX. For example, "„ÅÇ" in UTF-8 becomes "=E3=81=82". 7-bit printable characters such as "A" are not converted.
