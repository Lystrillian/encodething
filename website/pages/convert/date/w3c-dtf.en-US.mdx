## About W3C-DTF date and time

W3C-DTF is a date and time notation format defined by [W3C NOTE-datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). A subset limited to only some formats of ISO 8601.

The date and time are connected by "T" and written. The time zone is expressed as "+09:00" as the difference time from UTC, and in the case of UTC, it is expressed as "Z".

Separate seconds and milliseconds with a dot (.).

W3C-DTF is used as a date and time notation for HTTP headers and RSS.

For example, converting January 23, 2000 1:23:45.678 (JST; +09:00) to W3C-DTF results in the following:

```
2000-01-23T01:23:45.678+09:00
```
