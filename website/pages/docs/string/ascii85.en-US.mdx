## About Ascii85

Ascii85 is an encoding scheme that uses 7-bit printable ASCII characters, also known as Base85.

Ascii85 divides the data into 4 bytes each and converts them into 5 ASCII characters to represent them.

There are many variants of Ascii85, and DenCode supports the following three types of Ascii85. The original being btoa, followed by Adobe and Z85.

|  | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Z85 | Used by ZeroMQ." \\" (backslash) and "'" (apostrophe) characters that require escaping are not used. |
| Adobe | It is used to encode images and other data in Adobe's PostScript and PDF (Portable Document Format) files. It is enclosed in "\<~" and "\~>". |
| btoa | A form of the UNIX btoa command. It was used in the past for exchanging binary data, but is no longer common. Enclosed in "xbtoa Begin" and "xbtoa End" lines. |

The ASCII characters used in Ascii85 are as follows: treat the 4-byte value as a big-endian unsigned integer, calculate each digit (5 digits) of the 85 decimal system from it, and then find the Ascii85 conversion result based on the following ASCII characters

|  | ASCII characters |
| --- | --- |
| Z85 | 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-:+=^!/\*?&\<>()\[\]{}@%$# |
| Adobe | !"#$%&'()\*+,-./0123456789:;\<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\[\\\]^\_\`abcdefghijklmnopqrstu |
| btoa | !"#$%&'()\*+,-./0123456789:;\<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\[\\\]^\_\`abcdefghijklmnopqrstu  <br />(The original was from " " (space) to "t", but because some mailers excluded trailing spaces, it was later replaced by the "!" to "u" characters without spaces.) |

For example, if we convert "Hello" with Ascii85, it will look like this.

1\. Separate every 4 bytes; if less than 4 bytes, end with "00" for padding.

```
48656C6C<sub>(16)</sub> 6F000000<sub>(16)</sub>  (Hell o)
```

2\. Every 4 bytes are treated as a big-endian unsigned integer, and the value is converted to each digit of the 85 decimal system.

```
48656C6C<sub>(16)</sub>
= 1214606444<sub>(10)</sub>
= <b>23</b> * 85<sup>4</sup> + <b>22</b> * 85<sup>3</sup> + <b>66</b> * 85<sup>2</sup> + <b>52</b> * 85 + <b>49</b>
```

```
6F000000<sub>(16)</sub>
= 1862270976<sub>(10)</sub>
= <b>35</b> * 85<sup>4</sup> + <b>57</b> * 85<sup>3</sup> + <b>33</b> * 85<sup>2</sup> + <b>65</b> * 85 + <b>26</b>
```

3\. Convert each digit of the 85 decimal system to an ASCII character. If the end is padded with "00", the padding is excluded in the case of Adobe/Z85.

<table class="table table-sm table-fit"><tbody><tr><th></th><td>23</td><td>22</td><td>66</td><td>52</td><td>49</td><td></td><td>35</td><td>57</td><td>33</td><td>65</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><th>Z85</th><td>n</td><td>m</td><td>=</td><td>Q</td><td>N</td><td></td><td>z</td><td>V</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>Adobe</th><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>c</td><td>U</td><td>R</td><td></td><td>D</td><td>Z</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>btoa</th><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>c</td><td>U</td><td>R</td><td></td><td>D</td><td>Z</td><td>B</td><td>b</td><td>;</td></tr></tbody></table>

4\. The characters are all joined together to form the Ascii85 conversion result. adobe is enclosed in "\<~" & "\~>", with a new line every 80 characters. btoa is enclosed in "xbtoa Begin" & "xbtoa End" (including data length, checksum, etc.), with a new line every 78 characters.

|  | Conversion result |
| --- | --- |
| Z85 | nm=QNzV |
| Adobe | \<~87cURDZ~> |
| btoa | xbtoa Begin  <br /> 87cURDZBb;  <br />xbtoa End N 5 5 E 42 S 1f9 R a9f |

Several other contractions have been defined.

|  | Contractions |
| --- | --- |
| Z85 | None |
| Adobe | 00000000<sub>(16)</sub> -> z |
| btoa | 00000000<sub>(16)</sub> -> z  <br /> 20202020<sub>(16)</sub> -> y (btoa v4.2 or later)
