## About Line Sort

Line Sort is a string sorting algorithm that sorts a string by lines. It is commonly used in text processing and data analysis applications to organize and manipulate text data.

The algorithm works by splitting the input string into lines, sorting each line individually, and then joining the sorted lines back together. The sorted string is then returned.

## Usage

Line Sort is a utility function that can be used to sort a string by lines. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
INPUT:
This
is
a
string.


OUTPUT:
a
is
string.
This
```

## Parameters

### Ascending Order

By default, Line Sort sorts the string in ascending order. If you want to sort the string in descending order, you can set the `ascending` parameter to `false`.

```
INPUT:
this
is
a
string


OUTPUT:
a
is
string
this
```

### Descending Order

If you want to sort the string in descending order, you can set the `descending` parameter to `true`.

```
INPUT:
this
is
a
string


OUTPUT:
this
string
is
a
```

### Reverse Order

If you want to sort the string in reverse order, you can set the `reverse` parameter to `true`.

```
INPUT:
this
is
a
string


OUTPUT:
string
a
is
this
```

### Case Sensitivity

By default, Line Sort is case-sensitive, meaning that it considers uppercase and lowercase letters as different. If you want to make the sorting case-insensitive, you can set the `caseSensitive` parameter to `false`.
