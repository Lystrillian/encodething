## About Quoted-printable

Quoted-printable is an encoding method that uses 7-bit printable ASCII characters. Used to transfer 8-bit data in a 7-bit data path in email.

Quoted-printable represents 8-bit data in 2-digit hexadecimal format, such as =XX. For example, "„ÅÇ" in UTF-8 becomes "=E3=81=82". 7-bit printable characters such as "A" are not converted.

## Usage

Quoted-printable is a utility function that can be used to convert text to Quoted-printable. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
INPUT: This is a string.

OUTPUT: 'This is a string'.
```

## Parameters

### Quotes

The `quotes` parameter can be used to specify the type of quotes to use in the Quoted-printable encoding. The default value is `double`.

```
INPUT: This is a string.

OUTPUT: "This is a string."
```

```
INPUT: This is a string.

OUTPUT: 'This is a string.'
```
