## About conversion of half-width and full-width characters

Converts half-width characters and full-width characters to each other.

Supports letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), symbols, Japanese katakana, and Korean Hangul.

For example, the result of converting the half-width character "Hello, world!" To the full-width character is as follows.

```
Ｈｅｌｌｏ，　ｗｏｒｌｄ！
```

In addition, the result of converting the Japanese full-width katakana "サンプル" to half-width katakana is as follows. The voiced sound mark (゛) and semi-voiced sound mark (゜) are converted into one half-width character.

```
ｻﾝﾌﾟﾙ
```
