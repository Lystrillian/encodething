## About Text Reverse

Text Reverse is a string sorting algorithm that reverses the order of characters in a string. It is commonly used in text processing and data analysis applications to reverse the order of characters in a text file.

The algorithm works by iterating through the input string, reversing the order of each character, and joining them back together to form the reversed string.

## Usage

Text Reverse is a utility function that can be used to reverse the order of characters in a string. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
INPUT: This is a string.

OUTPUT: gnirts si sihT
```
