## About Line Unique

Line Unique is a string sorting algorithm that removes duplicate lines from a string. It is commonly used in text processing and data analysis applications to remove duplicate lines from a text file.

The algorithm works by iterating through the input string, checking for duplicate lines, and removing them if they are found. The remaining lines are then joined back together to form the sorted string.

## Usage
