## About Unicode Escape Sequence

Unicode escape sequence convert a single character to the format of a 4-digit hexadecimal code point, such as \\uXXXX. For example, "A" becomes "\\u0041".

In DenCode, in addition to the \\uXXXX format, the following notation formats are also supported.

| Format | Conversion result of "ABC" | Description / Programming language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \\uXXXX | \\u0041\\u0042\\u0043 | Common Unicode escape sequences |
| \\u\{X\} | \\u\{41\}\\u\{42\}\\u\{43\} | Lua |
| \\x\{X\} | \\x\{41\}\\x\{42\}\\x\{43\} | Perl |
| \\X | \\41\\42\\43 | CSS |
| &#xX; | &#x41;&#x42;&#x43; | HTML, XML |
| %uXXXX | %u0041%u0042%u0043 | Percent-encoding (Non-standard) |
| U+XXXX | U+0041 U+0042 U+0043 | Unicode standard notation for code points (Space separated) |
| 0xX | 0x41 0x42 0x43 | Hexadecimal notation of code points (Space separated) |

Some of the above formats are mentioned in [RFC 5137 (ASCII Escaping of Unicode Characters)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5137) as BEST CURRENT PRACTICE, but there is no international standard.

The %uXXXX format is supported by Microsoft IIS, but is a non-standard format. It can be encoded in %u format with [System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncodeUnicode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httputility.urlencodeunicode) in C#, but this method has been obsoleted since .NET Framework 4.5.

Please note that in the \\X format, a trailing single space is treated as a delimiter and ignored when decoding, [as specified by CSS](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes). In the U+XXXX and 0xX formats, each character is separated by a single space when encoded, and a trailing single space is ignored when decoded, as in the \\X format.

## Escaping by Unicode Name

As Unicode escape sequences, escaping by Unicode name is also supported.

| Format | Conversion result of "A" | Description / Programming language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \\N\{name\} | \\N\{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\} | C++23, Python, Perl |

Unicode names can be found at [Names List Charts - Unicode](https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/) or [NamesList.txt - Unicode](https://www.unicode.org/Public/15.0.0/ucd/NamesList.txt).

## Unicode non-BMP characters in Unicode escape sequence

Unicode non-BMP characters do not fit in the 4-digit code point, so they are represented in the following notation formats for each programming language.

The result of converting "ðŸ˜€" (U+1F600), which is a Unicode non-BMP character, is as follows.

| Format | Conversion result of "ðŸ˜€" (U+1F600) | Programming language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \\uXXXX | \\uD83D\\uDE00 | Java, Kotlin, Scala |
| \\u\{X\} | \\u\{1F600\} | C++23, Rust, Swift, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Dart, Lua |
| \\U00XXXXXX | \\U0001F600 | C, C++, Objective-C, C#, Go, Python, R |
| \\x\{X\} | \\x\{1F600\} | Perl |
| \\X | \\1F600 | CSS |
| &#xX; | &#x1F600; | HTML, XML |
| %uXXXX | %uD83D%uDE00 | \- |
| U+XXXX | U+1F600 | \- |
| 0xX | 0x1F600 | \- |
| \\N\{name\} | \\N\{GRINNING FACE\} | C++23, Python, Perl |

In the `\\uXXXX` and `%uXXXX` formats, non-BMP characters are represented by two code units as UTF-16 surrogate pairs. In other formats, a character is represented by a single code point.
