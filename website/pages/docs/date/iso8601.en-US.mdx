## About ISO 8601 date and time

ISO 8601 is a date and time notation format defined by ISO as an international standard.

The date and time are connected by "T" and written. The time zone is expressed as "+09:00" as the difference time from UTC, and in the case of UTC, it is expressed as "Z".

Separate seconds and milliseconds with a comma (,) or dot (.). Encodething omits milliseconds when milliseconds are 000.

ISO 8601 comes in several formats.

For example, converting January 23, 2000 1:23:45.678 (JST; +09:00) to ISO 8601 results in the following:

| Format | Conversion result |
| --- | --- |
| Basic format | 20000123T012345.678+0900 |
| Extended format | 2000-01-23T01:23:45.678+09:00 |
| Week dates (year - week - day of the week) | 2000-W03-7T01:23:45.678+09:00 |
| Ordinal dates (year - day of the year) | 2000-023T01:23:45.678+09:00 |
