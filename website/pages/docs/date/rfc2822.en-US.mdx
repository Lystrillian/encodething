## About RFC 2822 date and time

RFC 2822 is a date and time notation format defined in [RFC 2822 (Internet Message Format)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822).

RFC 2822 is used as the date and time notation in email headers.

For example, converting January 23, 2000 1:23:45.678 (JST) to RFC 2822 results in the following:

```
Sun, 23 Jan 2000 01:23:45 JST
```
