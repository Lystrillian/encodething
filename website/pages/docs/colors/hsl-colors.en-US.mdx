## About HSL Colors

HSL Colors are a color space that uses a combination of hue, saturation, and lightness to represent colors. It is a more intuitive and versatile alternative to RGB, which uses red, green, and blue values to represent colors.

HSL colors are often used in web design and programming to create more visually appealing and dynamic color schemes. They are also commonly used in graphic design, photography, and other visual arts.

## How does HSL Work?

### Hue

In HSL, the Hue determines what color of the rainbow something is. It’s represented in 360 degrees, like a traditional color wheel. One of the main advantages of HSL over RGB color is that complementary colors are located across from one another, which makes the whole system very intuitive.

### Saturation

The distance from the middle of the color wheel is called the ‘Saturation’, or how much of a given hue is present. Looking closely at the color wheel above, it is apparent that the color becomes brighter and more vivid as one travels from the center of the circle to the edge.

### Lightness

The Lightness value of an HSL color is in a third dimension, which actually makes the HSL system a cylinder:

As shown in the above diagram, the ‘Lightness’ of a color is a gradient between black and white, where the ‘bottom’ of the cylinder is a total black, and the ‘top’ of the cylinder is totally white.

## HSL Color Conversion

Encodething helps converting any color format to HSL. The conversion is done by using the following formulas:
