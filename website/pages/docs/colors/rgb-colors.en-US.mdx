## About RGB Colors

RGB Colors are a color space that uses red, green, and blue values to represent colors. It is a more intuitive and versatile alternative to HSV, which uses hue, saturation, and value to represent colors.

RGB colors are often used in web design and programming to create more visually appealing and dynamic color schemes. They are also commonly used in graphic design, photography, and other visual arts.
