## About LCH Colors

LCH Colors are a color space that uses a combination of lightness, chroma, and hue to represent colors. It is a more intuitive and versatile alternative to RGB, which uses red, green, and blue values to represent colors.

LCH colors are often used in web design and programming to create more visually appealing and dynamic color schemes. They are also commonly used in graphic design, photography, and other visual arts.
