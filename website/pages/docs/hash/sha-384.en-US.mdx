# SHA-384 Hash

SHA-384 (Secure Hash Algorithm 384-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that belongs to the SHA-2 family of hash functions, designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. SHA-384 is a truncated version of the SHA-512 hash function, producing a fixed-size 384-bit (48-byte) hash value, typically expressed as a 96-character hexadecimal string. It is used in various security applications and protocols that require a hash function with a larger output size than SHA-256 but do not need the full 512-bit output of SHA-512.

## Overview of SHA-384

The SHA-384 algorithm processes a variable-length input message and produces a fixed-size output hash value. The main steps in the SHA-384 algorithm are similar to those in SHA-512:

1. Padding: The input message is padded so that its length is a multiple of 1024 bits (128 bytes).
2. Appending length: A 128-bit representation of the original message's length is appended to the padded message.
3. Initializing hash values: Eight 64-bit hash values (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) are initialized with fixed constants derived from the square roots of the 9th through 16th prime numbers.
4. Processing the message in 1024-bit blocks: The algorithm iterates through the padded and appended message in 1024-bit blocks, updating the hash values using a series of operations and transformations involving non-linear functions, bitwise operations, and constants.
5. Output: The final values of the eight hash values are concatenated, and the resulting 512-bit hash value is truncated to 384 bits to form the SHA-384 hash value.

Like other hash functions in the SHA-2 family, SHA-384 is designed to be a one-way function, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to find an input message that produces a given hash value (preimage resistance) or to find two different messages that produce the same hash value (collision resistance).

## Applications of SHA-384

SHA-384 is used in various applications, including:

1. Digital signatures: SHA-384 is used in combination with other algorithms, such as ECDSA or RSA, to create digital signatures for verifying the authenticity and integrity of messages and documents, particularly in environments that require a higher level of security than provided by SHA-256.
2. Secure communication protocols: SHA-384 is used in secure communication protocols, such as TLS and SSL, to ensure the integrity of data transmitted over networks, especially when dealing with sensitive information or high-value transactions.
3. Key derivation functions: SHA-384 is used in key derivation functions, such as PBKDF2 and HKDF, to generate cryptographic keys from passwords or other input data.
4. Timestamping: SHA-384 is used in timestamping services to provide tamper-evident timestamps for digital documents and transactions.

The use of SHA-384 is often recommended in applications that require a higher level of security than provided by SHA-256, but where the full 512-bit output of SHA-512 is not necessary.

## Security of SHA-384

As of 2021, there are no known practical attacks that can break the security of SHA-384. The security of SHA-384 is based on the same properties as SHA-512:

1. Preimage resistance: Given a hash value, it is computationally infeasible to find an input message that produces that hash value.
2. Second preimage resistance: Given an input message, it is computationally infeasible to find another message that produces the same hash value.
3. Collision resistance: It is computationally infeasible to find two different messages that produce the same hash value.

The best-known theoretical attack against SHA-384 is the generic birthday attack, which has a complexity of about 2^192 operations, making it impractical with current computing capabilities.

## Conclusion

SHA-384 is a secure cryptographic hash function that produces a 384-bit hash value from an arbitrary-length input message. As a truncated version of SHA-512, it offers a higher level of security than SHA-256 while maintaining the same output size. Its preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, and collision resistance make it suitable for various security-critical applications, such as digital signatures, secure communication protocols, key derivation functions, and timestamping. As of 2021, there are no known practical attacks that can break the security of SHA-384, making it a reliable choice for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data in modern cryptographic systems and applications.
