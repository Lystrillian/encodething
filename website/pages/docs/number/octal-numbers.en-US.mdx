# Octal Numbers

Octal Number System has a base of eight and uses the numbers from 0 to 7. The octal numbers, in the number system, are usually represented by binary numbers when they are grouped in pairs of three. For example, an octal number 128 is expressed as 0010102 in the binary system, where 1 is equivalent to 001 and 2 is equivalent to 010.

## Definition

A number system which has its base as ‘eight’ is called an Octal number system. It uses numbers from 0 to 7. Let us take an example, to understand the concept. As we said, any number with base 8 is an octal number like 248, 1098, 558, etc.

Like Octal number is represented with base 8, in the same way, a binary number is represented with base 2, a decimal number with base 10 and the hexadecimal number is represented with base 16.

Examples of these number systems are:

22<sub>2</sub> is a binary number
100<sub>10</sub> is a decimal number
40<sub>16</sub> is a hexadecimal number

If we solve an octal number, each place is a power of eight.

124<sub>8</sub> = 1 × 8<sup>2</sup> + 2 × 8<sup>1</sup> + 4 × 8<sup>0</sup>

## Octal Numbers System Table

We use only 3 bits to represent Octal Numbers. Each group will have a distinct value between 000 and 111.

| Octal Digital Value      | Binary Equivalent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 0      | 000       |
| 1   | 001        |
| 2   | 010        |
| 3      | 011       |
| 4   | 100        |
| 5      | 101       |
| 6   | 110        |
| 7      | 111       |

Note: Octal number system supports digits from 0 to 7. Beyond 7, such as 8 and 9 are not octal digits. For example, 19 is not an octal number.


## Decimal to Octal Number

To convert decimal to octal numbers, the octal dabble method is used. In this method, the decimal number is divided by 8 each time, it yields or gives a remainder. The first remainder we get is the least significant digit(LSD) and the last remainder is the most significant digit(MSD). Let us understand the conversion with the help example.

### Example on Decimal to Octal

**Problem:** Suppose 560 is a decimal number, convert it into an octal number.

**Solution:** If 560 is a decimal number, then,

560/8 = 70 and the remainder is 0

70/8 = 8 and the remainder is 6

8/8 = 1 and the remainder is 0

And 1/8 = 0 and the remainder is 1

So the octal number starts from MSD to LSD, i.e. 1060

Therefore, 560<sub>10</sub> = 1060<sub>8</sub>

**Problem:** Convert 0.52 into an octal number.

**Solution:** The fraction part of the decimal number has to be multiplied by 8. 

0.52 × 8 = 0.16 with carry 4

0.16 × 8 = 0.28 with carry 1

0.28 × 8 = 0.24 with carry 2

0.24 × 8 = 0.92 with carry 1

So, for the fractional octal number, we read the generated carry from up to down.

Therefore, 4121 is the octal number.

## Octal to Decimal

To convert an octal number to a decimal number we need to multiply each digit of the given octal with the reducing power of 8. 

Let us learn here, the conversion of Octal number to Decimal Number or base 8 to base 10.

### Exampels on Octal to Decimal

**Example 1:** Suppose 2158 is an octal number, then it’s decimal form will be,

215<sub>8</sub> = 2 × 8<sup>2</sup> + 1 × 8<sup>1</sup> + 5 × 8<sup>0</sup>

          = 2 × 64+ 1 × 8 + 5 × 1 = 128 + 8 + 5

          =  141<sub>10</sub>

**Example 2:** Let 125 is an octal number denoted by 1258. Find the decimal number.

125<sub>8</sub> = 1× 8<sup>2</sup> + 2 × 8<sup>1</sup> + 5 × 8<sup>0</sup>

          = 1 × 64 + 2 × 8 + 5 × 1 = 64+16+5

          =85<sub>10</sub>

## Binary To Octal Number

A binary number can be converted into an octal number, with the help of the below-given table.

| Octal Digital Value      | Binary Equivalent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 0      | 000       |
| 1   | 001        |
| 2   | 010        |
| 3      | 011       |
| 4   | 100        |
| 5      | 101       |
| 6   | 110        |
| 7      | 111       |

### Example on Binary to Octal

**Example:** Convert (100010)<sub>2</sub> to an octal number.

**Solution:** With the help of the table we can write,

100→4

and 010→2

Therefore, (100010)<sub>2</sub> = 42

Similarly, we can convert an octal number to a binary number with the help of the table.

## Conclusion

In summary, the octal number system is a base-8 system that uses digits from 0 to 7. Octal numbers can be converted to and from decimal, binary, and other number systems using the methods described above. Understanding octal numbers is important in various fields, such as computer science and digital electronics, where they are used for representing and manipulating data efficiently. By mastering the concepts and conversion techniques presented in this article, you will be well-equipped to work with octal numbers in various contexts.
