## About ROT47

ROT47 is one of the single transliteration ciphers that encrypts by replacing the characters in the text with other characters.

Character replacement is performed by shifting the characters from "!" to "\~" by 47 characters out of the 94 characters of `!#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\{~}|`.

For example, "!" is encrypted to "P", "A" is encrypted to "p" and "0" is encrypted to "\_".

```
Plain : !"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
Cipher: PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
```

```
Plain text : THIS IS A SECRET MESSAGE 123!
Cipher text: %wx$ x$ p $tr#t% |t$$pvt `abP
```

Since there is reciprocity that plaintext can be obtained by encrypting ciphertext again, decryption can be done in the same flow as encryption.
