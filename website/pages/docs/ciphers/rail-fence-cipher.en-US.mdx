### About Rail Fence Cipher

Rail fence cipher is a transposition cipher.

Characters are arranged in a zigzag pattern on the rail of the fence, and finally, characters are concatenated in rails for encryption.

The encryption key is a number of rails.

For example, when "THIS\_IS\_A\_SECRET\_MESSAGE" is encrypted with 4 rails, it is as follows.

1\. Prepare four rails (height 4) and arrange the characters in zigzag from the upper left.

```
-----------------------------------------------
T           S           C           E          
-----------------------------------------------
  H       I   _       E   R       M   S       E
-----------------------------------------------
    I   _       A   S       E   _       S   G  
-----------------------------------------------
      S           _           T           A    
-----------------------------------------------
```

2\. Get the placed characters in each rail.

```
TSCE
HI_ERMSE
I_ASE_SG
S_TA
```

3\. Concatenated the rail characters.

```
TSCEHI_ERMSEI_ASE_SGS_TA
```
