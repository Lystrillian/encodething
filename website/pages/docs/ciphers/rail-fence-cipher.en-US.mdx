### About the Rail Fence cipher

The Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher.

Characters are arranged in a zigzag order on the rails of the fence, and finally the characters are combined into rails for encryption.

The encryption key represents multiple rails.

For example, if "THIS\_IS\_A\_SECRET\_MESSAGE" is encrypted with 4 rails, it is as follows.

1\. Prepare four rails (height 4) and arrange the characters in a zigzag pattern on the top left.


```
-----------------------------------------------
T S C E          
-----------------------------------------------
  H I _ E R M S E
-----------------------------------------------
    I _ A S E _ S G  
-----------------------------------------------
      S _ T A    
-----------------------------------------------
```

2\. Get the placed characters in each rail.

```
TSCE
HI_ERMSE
I_ASE_SG
S_TA
```

3\. Concatenation of rail symbols.

```
TSCEHI_ERMSEI_ASE_SGS_TA
```
