# Code Policy

**Effective Date: March 2024**

Encodething recognizes that its customers' code is their proprietary intellectual property, which could cause significant harm to their business if made public or shared with unauthorized parties. Accordingly, this Code Policy sets forth the steps taken by Encodething to safeguard the confidentiality of the code that is processed by Encodething's products and services (the "Code Data").

This policy refers specifically to the code that is processed locally by official Encodething editor extensions. Code Data is not uploaded to Encodething servers and is not stored by Encodething. Other user data, including but not limited to customer emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, analytics data relating to use of the Encodething website, or general metadata collected about customers' usage and traffic patterns, is governed by the Privacy Policy, not the Code Policy.

Encodething does not use Code Data to develop its products and services.
Encodething does not share Code Data with any third parties.
Encodething reserves the right to modify this Code Policy at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. The latest version of the Code Policy can be found at url.
